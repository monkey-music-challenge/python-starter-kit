# Python starter kit

### Prerequisites

First of all, go to http://monkeymusicchallenge.com, sign up and get your API key.

For this starter kit, you will need basic knowledge of:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Make sure to have the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install) library installed on your system.

We recommend installing packages using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).

Also, if you run into trouble, make sure to use Python 2.7 or newer.

### Getting started

Start by [forking](https://github.com/monkey-music-challenge/python-starter-kit/fork)
this repository to your own GitHub user.

Then, open up a terminal and:

```
git clone git@github.com:<username>/python-starter-kit.git
cd python-starter-kit
pip install requests
python main.py <your-team-name> <your-api-key>
```

These are all UNIX commands. Got Windows? We recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

Make sure to surf to your team page before running the above commands...

Your monkey is waiting for you!

### How to complete the warmup challenge

`main.py` contains the boilerplate needed to communicate with the server. You should not need to change anything in here unless we have done something wrong.

We suggest you go straight to `ai.py` and start playing around with the code.

Remember, your mission is to:

* guide your monkey through the warmup level
* pick up all the music items
* get them to the eagerly awaiting Spotify user

Have fun!

### Bugs

When you find bugs in our code, please submit an issue or pull request to our [original starter kit repository](https://github.com/monkey-music-challenge/python-starter-kit).
